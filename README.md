# 🧱 Multi-Layered Architecture Application

This project is a working prototype built to demonstrate a **Multi-Layered Architecture** using **SQL Server**, **ADO.Net**, **Microsoft Visual Studio**, and **Text File Handling**. The solution follows best practices by separating concerns across multiple layers for better modularity and maintainability.

## 🏗️ Architecture Overview

The application is structured into four key layers:

- 🎨 **Presentation Layer**  
  Handles the user interface and interactions.

- 🧠 **Business Logic Layer (BLL)**  
  Contains core application logic, including validation and processing.

- 🗃️ **Data Access Layer (DAL)**  
  Manages interactions with the database using ADO.Net.

- 🧩 **Data Layer**  
  Directly connects to **SQL Server** for CRUD operations.

Additionally, the prototype includes **text file handling** for supplementary features such as logging.

## ⚙️ Technologies Used

- **C#**
- **ADO.Net**
- **Microsoft SQL Server**
- **Text File Handling**
- **Visual Studio**

## ✅ Key Benefits

- 📦 Clear separation of concerns
- 🔄 Easy to maintain and scale
- 🛠️ Aligned with enterprise development standards
